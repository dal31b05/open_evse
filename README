This fork is to run on the Rolec ACSE 0020 EVSE controler hardware.

It adds the functionality to be controlled by the EVSE RAPI protocol over the serial port.

It can be used (untested) with the ESP8266 wifi controller BUT needs level conversion as the Open_EVSE controller uses TTL levels whereas the Rolec uses RS232 levels.

NOTES:
- Working versions of the required libraries are included in the libraries/ folder
- Arduino 1.6.x is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for compiling OpenEVSE. Older versions of Arduino will build sketches which are too big to fit into OpenEVSE, unless features are disabled.
